Taxonomy Child Links
============================

This module adds a Views handler so that Views of taxonomy terms (like the
Ubercart-provided `taxonomy_terms` view) can display child links for taxonomy
terms, as catalog term listings did in Drupal 6.

Installation
------------

Install this module using [the official Backdrop CMS instructions](https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules).

Use this handler to render taxonomy terms in your Views showing links to child
terms. For example, you can create a View that lists Ubercart catalog terms at a
given level, and then add a Child links field to each entry to display links to
the child terms.
